# Privacy Policy for Plated: Recipes & Groceries

This Privacy Policy outlines how Plated: Recipes & Groceries ("the App") handles your information. Your privacy is a priority, and the App is designed to collect only the absolute minimum data necessary to function.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**No Accounts:** You are not required to create an account or provide an email address to use the App.

**Local Storage:** All core app usage happens locally on your device. Any recipes you create, grocery lists you build, or preferences you set are stored entirely on your phone. We do not upload your personal recipe library, grocery lists, or usage data to our servers.

**No Tracking:** The App does not track your location, browsing behavior, or usage patterns for advertising purposes. We do not use third-party behavioral analytics or advertising services that could collect your personal data.

## 2. Third-Party Data Processors (GDPR Compliance)

While core data is stored locally, we use specific third-party service providers ("Data Processors") to enable certain premium features (such as AI extraction and in-app purchases). When you use these features, limited data may be transmitted to them:

*   **Google LLC (Gemini AI):** Used for AI recipe extraction. If you provide a web link or an image to extract a recipe, this content is sent to Google's Gemini API for processing. Your request may also include your IP address for routing purposes. Google does not use your data to train their enterprise models.
*   **Supadata:** Used to extract data and transcripts from shared URLs (such as YouTube or TikTok links). Only the specific URL you choose to import is sent to their API.
*   **RevenueCat:** Used to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat collects anonymous data such as purchase history, IP addresses, and basic device identifiers to validate and manage your access. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or exact physical location.

### International Data Transfers
These third-party processors are primarily based in the United States. By using features such as AI Recipe Extraction or In-App Purchases, you acknowledge that the limited data required to provide these features (such as URLs, images, or anonymous device identifiers) will be transferred to and processed in the United States. These transfers are safeguarded under standard data protection mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, depending on the provider.

## 3. Data Retention

Data sent to our third-party processors (Google Gemini and Supadata) is processed in real-time. We do not persistently store the links or images you share, nor do we link these requests to a personal profile. 

## 4. Email Communication

If you choose to contact us via email for support or feedback:

*   Your email address and the content of your message will be used solely to respond to your inquiry.
*   We do not sell, rent, or share your contact information with any third parties.

## 5. Community Feature

The App includes a link in your Profile that directs you to our external community platform. The App does not transmit any of your local data, recipes, or personal information to this community platform. Your participation in the community is entirely optional and any data you share there is governed by the privacy policy of the hosting platform.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
