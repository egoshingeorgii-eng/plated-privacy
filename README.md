## Introduction

Plated: Recipes & Groceries ("we", "our", or "us") is operated by Georgii Egoshin and located in Novi Sad, Serbia. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we share it when you use the Plated: Recipes & Groceries mobile app and related backend services.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account/Contact Info**: Email address if you choose to provide it.
- **Recipe Content You Create or Import**: Recipe title, description, ingredients, steps, notes, ratings, and edits.
- **AI Import Inputs**:
  - Links you submit (for example TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or web recipe URLs).
  - Photos you upload for AI extraction.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Device and App Data**: Device type, OS version, app version, basic diagnostics/crash data.
- **Subscription Data**: Entitlement and purchase status from RevenueCat and Apple.
- **Feature Usage Data**: Feature usage events (for example AI extraction usage counters).

### Data Generated by Our Systems

- **AI Extraction Outputs**: Structured recipe text generated from your import input.
- **Processing Metadata**: Timestamps, cache/debug flags, and operational metadata.

## How We Use Information

We use data to:

- Provide recipe features, including AI extraction and recipe management.
- Operate, secure, and improve the app and backend services.
- Process subscriptions and purchases.
- Measure feature reliability and usage.
- Respond to support and legal requests.

## Where Data Is Stored

### On-Device Storage

- Imported and user-created recipes are stored locally on your device by default.

### Backend Storage (Cloud)

Our backend currently stores limited operational records, including:

- **AI extraction cache records** (for performance and reliability).
- **Usage event logs** (for feature usage tracking).
- **Recipe ratings** (when submitted).
- **Recipe catalog data** used by the app journey feed.

### Cloud Recipe Sync (If Enabled)

If cloud sync for user-imported recipes is enabled in your app version/account, we may store structured recipe fields such as:

- title
- ingredients
- steps
- duration/difficulty/expense
- non-sensitive recipe metadata
- optional source URL (`videoUrl`) when needed for source linking or deduplication

For cloud recipe sync, we intend to avoid storing raw uploaded photo files as part of synced recipe records.

## AI Processing and Source Providers

To provide AI extraction, we may send user-provided inputs (text, links, or photos) to our backend and processors.

Depending on feature path, this can include:

- URL metadata/transcript retrieval providers
- AI model providers for recipe extraction

These providers process data on our behalf according to their terms.
