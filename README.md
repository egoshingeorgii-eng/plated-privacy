# Privacy Policy for Plated: Recipes & Groceries

This Privacy Policy outlines how Plated: Recipes & Groceries ("the App") handles your information. Your privacy is a priority, and the App is designed to collect only the absolute minimum data necessary to function.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**No Accounts:** You are not required to create an account or provide an email address to use the App.

**Local Storage:** All core app usage happens locally on your device. Any recipes you create, grocery lists you build, or preferences you set are stored entirely on your phone. We do not upload your personal recipe library, grocery lists, or usage data to our servers.

**No Tracking:** The App does not track your location, browsing behavior, or usage patterns for advertising purposes. We do not use third-party behavioral analytics or advertising services that could collect your personal data.

## 2. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

To manage in-app purchases (such as Magic Imports and premium access), we use a third-party service called RevenueCat. When you make a purchase or subscribe, RevenueCat collects anonymous data such as purchase history, subscription status, and basic device identifiers to validate and manage your access. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or exact location.

## 3. AI Recipe Extraction Features

If you use our AI features to extract a recipe from a web link (e.g., YouTube or TikTok) or an image:

*   **Temporary Processing:** The URL or image you provide is sent to our backend services and third-party AI providers (such as Google or OpenAI) solely for the purpose of analyzing the content and generating the recipe.
*   **No Long-Term Storage:** This data is processed in real time. We do not persistently store the links or images you share, nor do we link these requests to a personal profile.

## 4. Email Communication

If you choose to contact us via email for support or feedback:

*   Your email address and the content of your message will be used solely to respond to your inquiry.
*   We do not sell, rent, or share your contact information with any third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
